- what happens if channel operations run in the main thread?
    ^ this is currently unsuppored as main thread is running outside of scheduler

- write handling for case where env that needs to run is in another thread

- convert all types to stdint.h types to improve portability

- make sure that pull_from_queue waits until there are no envs in either hash_pull or hash_push
  which match the current thread_id. if there are envs that match the current thread_id, they might 
  eventually get unblocked by another thread's functions.
